### Notes/Assumptions

* Assumptions or Simplifications:
    * The state of a simulation is stored as an integer value.
        * The default state for a simulation is assumed to be 0 and simulation states are a positive
          integer value.
        * The number of states method lets the front end know how many states to expect. For
          example, if the number of states is 3, then the valid states should be 0 (default), 1, 2.

    * We assumed the typical usage of Percolation such that water flows from the top and only
      considers the adjacent neighbors (not the diagonals).
    * In WaTor World, we assumed that the sharks will be processed first, so if a shark moves to a
      cell before a fish moves, the fish will be removed and will not have the opportunity to move.
      Thus, we process sharks first, then as long as the fish cells are untouched, we move those to
      new cells.
