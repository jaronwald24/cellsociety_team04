### Notes/Assumptions

 * Assumptions or Simplifications:
   * We assumed the typical usage of Percolation such that water flows from the top and only considers the adjacent neighbors (not the diagonals).
   * In WaTor World, we assumed that the sharks will be processed first, so if a shark moves to a cell before a fish moves, the fish will be removed and will not have the opportunity to move. Thus, we process sharks first, then as long as the fish cells are untouched, we move those to new cells.

 * Features unimplemented:
