### CRC Card Classes

This class's purpose or value is to represent a customer's order:

|Order| |
|---|---|
|boolean isInStock(OrderLine)         |OrderLine|
|double getTotalPrice(OrderLine)      |Customer|
|boolean isValidPayment (Customer)    | |
|void deliverTo (OrderLine, Customer) | |


This class's purpose or value is to represent a customer's order:
```java
public class Order {
     // returns whether or not the given items are available to order
     public boolean isInStock (OrderLine items)
     // sums the price of all the given items
     public double getTotalPrice (OrderLine items)
     // returns whether or not the customer's payment is valid
     public boolean isValidPayment (Customer customer)
     // dispatches the items to be ordered to the customer's selected address
     public void deliverTo (OrderLine items, Customer customer)
 }
 ```

This class's purpose or value is to manage something:
```java
public class Something {
     // sums the numbers in the given data
     public int getTotal (Collection<Integer> data)
	 // creates an order from the given data
     public Order makeOrder (String structuredData)
 }
```


### Use Cases

* A new game is started with five players, their scores are reset to 0.
 ```java
 Something thing = new Something();
 Order o = thing.makeOrder("coffee,large,black");
 o.update(13);
 ```

* A player chooses his RPS "weapon" with which he wants to play for this round.
 ```java
 Something thing = new Something();
 Order o = thing.makeOrder("coffee,large,black");
 o.update(13);
 ```

* Given three players' choices, one player wins the round, and their scores are updated.
 ```java
 Something thing = new Something();
 Order o = thing.makeOrder("coffee,large,black");
 o.update(13);
 ```

* A new choice is added to an existing game and its relationship to all the other choices is updated.
 ```java
 Something thing = new Something();
 Order o = thing.makeOrder("coffee,large,black");
 o.update(13);
 ```

* A new game is added to the system, with its own relationships for its all its "weapons".
 ```java
 Something thing = new Something();
 Order o = thing.makeOrder("coffee,large,black");
 o.update(13);
 ```
